Analysis of stock data
# Challenge
The new analysis contains a refactored code to make it more performing for future years of stock data to come. The code pulls data based on the year and ticker information compared to the prior code that just updated based on the current years of data provided which are 2017 and 2018. This will allow Steve to make an informed decision on more prior years and/or if he would like to update the outcomes in future years on the stock data.
